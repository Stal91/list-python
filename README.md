# list-python
The code is a console program that allows the user to interact with a list. It enters an infinite loop using while True

Insert an item into the list: The user can choose the "I" option and then input a value that will be added to the list.

List the items in the list: If the user chooses the "L" option, the program displays the index and value of each element in the list using enumerate(lista).

Delete an item from the list: If the user chooses the "A" option, the program prompts the user to enter an index to delete a specific item from the list. If the index is valid, the program removes the element from the list using del lista[indice].
